# Coding Challenge: Playlists

Welcome to the coding challenge.

This challenge will give us an idea about your coding skills. Don't worry if you can't finish all requirements in time. Just tell us how you would proceed.

We're using Rails 4, RSpec 3.5 etc.

In the `csv` folder you find some data files.

## Tasks

- [x] Create a rails application within this repo and commit as usual
- [ ] Update the README inside with information on how to work with it if you think that some information might be helpful
- [ ] Set up an appropriate data model for the data in the csv files
- [x] Create an import for the users
- [x] Create a simple controller/view to show a list of users
- [ ] Create a simple REST API endpoint that returns a list of users as json. The REST API can be treated as internal only so no authentication/authorization is needed here.
- [ ] Create an import for the playlists and mp3
- [ ] Extend the users view to also show the playlists each user has

## UseCases

- [x] Import users
- [x] List users
- [x] Import MP3
- [ ] Import Playlists
- [ ] List Playlists of the user
